1. For the Raspberry Pi 4B board:

- Compile the dtdemo_platdrv module
- Run the helper script dtb_gen_rpi onboard ... it generates the original DTS,
  validates the (already existing) rpi4b_dtb_stuff/rpi4b_gen_dtdemo.dts DTS and
  then builds the new DTB, copies it into /boot, sets up to use it (via /boot/config.txt).
  Follow the steps and it should just work

2. For the TI Beagle Bone Black board:

- Require to generate a DT overlay here, and load it via U-Boot (only)
- Have done so using a s very simple DT overlay DTS file (bbb_dtb_stuff/dtdemo_overlay.dts)
  and generate the DTBO like this:
  dtc -I dts -@ -O dtb -o dtdemo_overlay.dtbo dtdemo_overlay.dts
- Difficult to test directly on the default BBB Debian OS; so, have used Michael Opdenacker's
  v simple test initramfs image to successfully load up the DTBO at boot!
- In effect, it will work on the BBB - the DT overlay enabled psuedo 'device'
  does show up in the DT, thus the driver will work... BUT the initrd img doesn't
  have the driver to actually test this...
